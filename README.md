# terraform-aws-audit-log-bucket

This Terraform module deploys an Amazon S3 bucket and IAM role suitable for use with the [Common Fate S3 Log Destination integration](https://docs.commonfate.io/integrations/s3-log-destination). You can use this module directly, or fork it and use it as a base for your own audit logging infrastructure module.
